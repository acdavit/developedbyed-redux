# developedbyed-redux

I rewrote the code from [Redux For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY&ab_channel=developedbyed) tutorial on [developedbyed](https://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed)'s youtube channel. This repository is also good for getting your hands dirty with the React-Redux library.
